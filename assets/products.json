        "description": "The HTTP 304 Not Modified client redirection response code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources. This response code is sent when the request is a conditional GET or HEAD request with an If-None-Match or an If-Modified-Since header and the condition evaluates to false. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource that would have resulted in a 200 OK response if the condition evaluated to true.\nThe response must not contain a body and must include the headers that would have been sent in an equivalent 200 OK response: Cache-Control, Content-Location, Date, ETag, Expires, and Vary.",
